Original Prusa i3 MK3S/MK2.5S/MMU2S upgrades - V1.02
----------------------------------------------------

Below is a list of parts need for the upgrade, choose your current printer and then the one you are upgrading to. Note that some parts are included in the upgrade package as it is difficult to print them yourself.

We recommend using black filament to print all MK3S and MK2.5S extruder parts. If you want different colour, you can use it, but the FS-lever part should be definitely dark (black) and the other parts surrounding the IR-Sensor as well. In case you use any lighter colour for the FS-lever it might not trigger the sensor.

All the packages are available for download at: https://www.prusa3d.com/prusa-i3-printable-parts/
